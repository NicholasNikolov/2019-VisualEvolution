# 2019 VisualEvolution [GUIDED PROJECT]
 Inspired by chapter 9 from the book "Math Adventures with Python" I set to learn how to visualize a genetic evolution scenario with my own set of rules. Initially I begin by following the textbook examples but eventually the goal is to develop my own simulation with my own rules!

Project Progress: In-progress [Temporarily Shelved]

Data Source: N/A

Note: The code comes from the textbook listed. I did not develop any of this code.
